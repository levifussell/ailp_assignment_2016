For assignments, you are requested to submit a pdf document.

The key fines are:

ailp_latex_template.tex : source file
ailp_latex_template.pdf : formatted version
carneades.png :           included image.
ailp_latex_biblio.bib:    bibliography items.

This indicates how to include images.
You may want some references -- examples are given, as are
some ways of presenting data.

To format:
if you use bibtex for references, need 4 commands:

% pdflatex ailp_latex_template
% bibtex ailp_latex_template
% pdflatex ailp_latex_template
% pdflatex ailp_latex_template

Otherwise, simply:

% pdflatex ailp_latex_template

AS.
